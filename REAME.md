# PDF Statement Generator (Generator Oświadczeń Pracownika)

A web application built with Streamlit to automate the creation of a monthly work statement (_oświadczenie pracownika_). It allows users to list completed projects, automatically calculates the next billing period based on saved history, and generates a print-ready PDF document with a user-provided digital signature.



## Key Features

-   **Interactive Web Interface**: No more command-line inputs. All data is entered through a user-friendly web form.
-   **Dynamic Project List**: Easily add or remove work items before generating the document.
-   **Automatic Period Calculation**: The app saves the end date of the last period and automatically suggests the next 30-day period.
-   **Persistent Signature**: Upload your signature once, and the app will save and remember it for future use.
-   **History Management**: Manually override the last period's end date directly from the UI if needed.
-   **Bilingual UI**: The application interface can be switched between Polish and English.
-   **Direct PDF Download**: Generate and download the final PDF document with a single click.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or newer is recommended)


## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

**1. Get the Code**

Either download the project files as a ZIP or clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

-   **Create the environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
-   **Activate it:**
    -   On **Windows**:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On **macOS & Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

**3. Install Required Libraries**

With your virtual environment active, install all the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can launch the application with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your default web browser will automatically open a new tab with the running application.

## How to Use the App

1.  **Launch the app** using the command above.
2.  **Set Up Signature**: In the sidebar (**Settings**), use the file uploader to select a `.png` file of your signature. The app will save it for future sessions.
3.  **Manage History (Optional)**: If you need to correct the billing cycle, use the "Period History" section in the sidebar to set the last known end date.
4.  **Add Work Items**: In the main window, fill in the "Project name" and "Description of work" fields and click "Add work to the list". Repeat for all tasks completed in the period.
5.  **Set Period & Link**: Provide the shared evidence link and choose the billing period (the automatic option is recommended).
6.  **Generate PDF**: Click the "Generate PDF" button at the bottom.
7.  **Download**: A download button will appear, allowing you to save the generated document. The PDF will also be saved locally in the `Ready PDFs/` folder.

## File Structure

All files generated by the application are stored locally within the project folder.

```
